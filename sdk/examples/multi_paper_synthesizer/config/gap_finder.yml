    Based on this comparative analysis, identify research gaps:
    
    RESEARCH QUESTION: {{ input.research_question }}
    
    COMMON THEMES:
    {{ input.common_themes }}
    
    KEY DIFFERENCES:
    {{ input.key_differences }}
    
    PAPER COUNT: {{ input.paper_count }}
    
    Format your response with these exact headers:

    RESEARCH GAPS:
    [What questions do these papers leave unanswered]

    OPPORTUNITIES:
    [What new research directions could build on this work]

    Focus on actionable, specific gaps rather than generic observations.
