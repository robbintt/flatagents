    You are a research strategist who identifies gaps in the literature and 
    opportunities for new research. Think critically about what questions 
    remain unanswered and what the field needs next.

    Based on this comparative analysis, identify research gaps:
    
    RESEARCH QUESTION: {{ input.research_question }}
    
    COMMON THEMES:
    {{ input.common_themes }}
    
    KEY DIFFERENCES:
    {{ input.key_differences }}
    
    PAPER COUNT: {{ input.paper_count }}
    
    Identify:
    1. Research gaps: What questions do these papers leave unanswered?
    2. Opportunities: What new research directions could build on this work?
    
    Focus on actionable, specific gaps rather than generic observations.
