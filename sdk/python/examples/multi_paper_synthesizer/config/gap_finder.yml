    Based on this comparative analysis, identify research gaps:
    
    RESEARCH QUESTION: {{ input.research_question }}
    
    COMMON THEMES:
    {{ input.common_themes }}
    
    KEY DIFFERENCES:
    {{ input.key_differences }}
    
    PAPER COUNT: {{ input.paper_count }}
    
    Identify:
    1. Research gaps: What questions do these papers leave unanswered?
    2. Opportunities: What new research directions could build on this work?
    
    Focus on actionable, specific gaps rather than generic observations.
