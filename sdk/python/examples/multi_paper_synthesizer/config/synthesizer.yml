    Synthesize these findings into a comprehensive research synthesis:
    
    RESEARCH QUESTION: {{ input.research_question }}
    NUMBER OF PAPERS: {{ input.paper_count }}
    
    COMMON THEMES:
    {{ input.common_themes }}
    
    KEY DIFFERENCES:
    {{ input.key_differences }}
    
    RESEARCH GAPS:
    {{ input.research_gaps }}
    
    OPPORTUNITIES:
    {{ input.opportunities }}
    
    Create a 4-5 paragraph synthesis that:
    1. Directly answers the research question
    2. Weaves together common themes into a unified narrative
    3. Addresses key differences and how they can be reconciled
    4. Highlights the most important research gaps
    5. Recommends next steps based on the opportunities identified
